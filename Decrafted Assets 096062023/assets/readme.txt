I see you somehow figured out how to get into server resourcepack, nice job!

Before you start ramming through files and seeing how we do stuff, remember that:
- You can't reuse the assets found in ../decrafted and ../minecraft/textures/item folder since they're owned by Decrafted Team or specifically OG_MrRubberDucky
- ../space is Negative Font Space by AmberWat, you can get it here: https://github.com/AmberWat/NegativeSpaceFont

Feel free to learn from this.
