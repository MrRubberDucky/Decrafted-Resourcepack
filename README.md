# Decrafted-Resourcepack
Everything made by me that was supposed to be used in Decrafted but due to internal disagreements, it didn't end up making the cut.

It was intended to be used in Decrafted, a Minecraft pure server-side Fabric project. Some files were lost in time and this isn't a full resourcepack either way so not as usable but it should give general idea how to replicate the same in Vanilla resourcepacks.

You can re-use these assets but only if you credit OG_MrRubberDucky (My Minecraft Name) in your project. (MIT License)

`/aseprite/` folder contains source material, you can open it via a program called Aseprite which is a nice Pixel Art tool.
